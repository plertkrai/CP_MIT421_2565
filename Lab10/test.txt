Looker Studio is a free tool that turns your data into informative, easy to read, easy to share, and fully customizable dashboards and reports. Use the drag and drop report editor to:
Tell your data story with charts, including line, bar, and pie charts, geo maps, area and bubble graphs, paginated data tables, pivot tables, and more.
Make your reports interactive with viewer filters and date range controls. The data control turns any report into a flexible template report that anyone can use to see their own data.
Include links and clickable images to create product catalogs, video libraries, and other hyperlinked content.
Annotate and brand your reports with text and images.
Apply styles and color themes that make your data stories works of data visualization art.
